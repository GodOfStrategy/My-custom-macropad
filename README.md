# My-custom-macropad
Made with and for Blueprint @ Hackclub. It is my personal hackpad, with the keys W,A,S,D with various utility.

My hackpad uses:
1. XIAO-SAMD21-DIP as the MCU (sourced from Hackclub hq)
2. 4 push switches as my keys.(sourced from Hackclub hq)

Here are the schematics:

I modeled my Case for it in Fusion 360, I kept it open from two sides for future potential debugging, access and easy heat dissapation.
